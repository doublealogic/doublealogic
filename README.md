Frontend Developer with a proven ability to collaborate with teams of varying size and background while prioritizing team workflows to achieve quality results under strict time constraints. With a passion for learning and self-improvement, I worked through a 24-week 900+ hour Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I learned JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Dashboarding, Geomapping, Python, Excel, Machine Learning, SQL/Databases, Tableau and API Interactions. As a natural leader, I successfully guided research for appropriate data sources for team projects and oversaw the completion of necessary Git merges to streamline project version control. Mentoring 30+ fellow Sales Engineers in their training and studies, I helped contribute to over $3.2 million in sales. I am now passionate about obtaining a challenging position that will both expand my skills as a developer and enhance the user experience and user interface.
